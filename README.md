# hybrid-system-design-waste-management
Population growth in the world, migration to areas with high population density in cities, and increases in the amount of daily waste due to the increase in demand for ready-made consumption cause waste management problems. Protection of the environment and climate, which are among the sustainable development goals, can be achieved through waste management. With the development of technology, the idea of living in smart cities that develop fast and digital solutions in energy distribution, lighting, road planning, transportation, security and waste collection is becoming widespread. Developed campuses with their own habitat, infrastructure and environment can host the pilot implementation of smart cities. Although many studies have been carried out on waste management and garbage detection, a comprehensive system that benefits from today's technology and methods has not yet been proposed. For this reason, in this project; While aiming to reduce cost and workload by making use of sensor technology, autonomous aerial vehicles and image processing methods, the design of a hybrid waste management system that will algorithmically calculate the most appropriate route is proposed. With traditional waste collection methods, garbage containers that have reached occupancy rates above their capacity are not detected, and the waste of these containers is collected only on certain routes and in certain periods. In order to prevent these situations that cause environmental pollution, sensor placement that transmits the occupancy rate in the most accurate way will be carried out with sensor technology. For containers at distances where wireless information transmission is weak, the system will classify the images taken by autonomous aerial vehicles and transmit the occupancy and clutter information of the container to the center. The output of this entire hybrid system will calculate the most appropriate and lowest-cost route for waste collection vehicles, taking into account urgency and distance. A smart road map will be created by providing smart waste management through the containers located at Yıldız Technical University Davutpaşa Campus.

In this study, a hybrid waste management system was designed to ensure route optimization by calculating the occupancy rates of garbage bins. In the project, data was collected from garbage containers, communication of these data was ensured, and the occupancy rates were calculated by processing the received data with regression algorithms. The calculated occupancy data was successfully written to the database and these data were supported by image processing algorithms. Our study shows that it has the potential to save money on waste management. Effective use of sensor data and movement of containers with servos played an important role in the effectiveness of the system. Calculating the occupancy rates of the containers with the distance data received from the sensors and ensuring communication between the devices increased the operational efficiency of the system. However, there are some limitations and opposing views in this study. For example, the success of the system largely depends on the accuracy of the sensors and the uninterruptedness of data communication. Any malfunction in sensors or interruptions in data communication may negatively affect the performance of the system. Additionally, it should be taken into account that image processing algorithms may be affected by environmental factors (light conditions, weather, etc.) and may lead to errors in calculating occupancy rates. These factors show that the system may not provide the desired performance under all conditions. However, the results of our study offer significant potential in the fields of waste management and route optimization. In the future, further development of sensors and data processing algorithms can improve the accuracy and reliability of the system. Additionally, the generalizability and adaptability of the system can be examined through tests conducted in different cities and conditions. In conclusion, this study offers promising results in waste management and route optimization and can be further improved with future improvements and extensive testing. When evaluated together with the findings obtained from other studies in this field, it is predicted that the system may have a wider application area.
